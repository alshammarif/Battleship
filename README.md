# Battleship

Some Code inspired by: https://github.com/bigardone/phoenix-battleship/tree/1077e13eb871ab4fd52eef09c1b42cabd44f4d8f
No code was taken directly from source but was looked at as a model. 

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
